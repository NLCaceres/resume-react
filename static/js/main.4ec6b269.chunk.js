In the class that first taught me Android development, we were asked to create an app that would help those in their day-to-day lives whether that was an acessibility issue, a handicap, or simply a health-related concern. Being a Biology major focused in Neuroscience, I immediately thought about the issue of mental illness. I hoped to create an app that would help users to be able to voice their concerns about their mental well-being if they felt they could not do so. Ideally I could create a chat system, map out local mental health professionals, display helpful articles and create a simple login. The biggest concern, and ultimately the task I could not complete, was the chat system. I had hoped to create a system that would connect users who felt they could help in certain topics whether relationships, depression, or simply daily troubles with users who were having trouble in these topics. Though the system was established programmatically with Firebase (just before Google acquired it), it didn't function as intended. Consequently, the remainder was fleshed out as best as possible within the time frame, and the chat system was kept basic. Despite my shortcomings, it taught me a number of important lessons from project management, laying out tasks, and interacting with a number of different technologies.",image:{src:"../images/beach.jpeg",alt:"Home screen with a tab view to each section of the app, namely the chat, the articles and the healthcare providers."}},"hospital-app":{name:"Infection Control",desc:"This app started in Android before moving more recently into iOS.
