In my USC class ITP 301, we were instructed to create a fansite for one of our favorite TV shows. At the time, the Walking Dead was probably at its highest viewership with the shock of the season 7 opening and 6 excellent seasons prior. In my little project, I\'d create a simple html file with simple css talking about main characters and the first 5 seasons.","images":[{"src":"https://i.imgur.com/92xr3mE.png","alt":"Walking Dead Fan Site with descriptions of seasons 1 through 5 as well as several main character descriptions"}],"github":"https://github.com/NLCaceres/WD-show-fanpage","url":"https://nlcaceres.github.io/WD-show-fanpage/"},{"name":"My Girlfriend and I\'s Photo Gallery","desc":"As a part of the second assignment for my ITP 301 class, we made a point of overviewing jQuery for a couple weeks which culminated in this project, a simple gallery using jQuery to highlight images and swap in any one that was clicked into a main image frame.","images":[{"src":"https://i.imgur.com/wDMkYkJ.png","alt":"Column of photos along the left side with a main image on the right"}],"github":"https://github.com/NLCaceres/jQuery-gallery","url":"https://nlcaceres.github.io/jQuery-gallery/"},{"name":"Color my Life","desc":"In the third assignment for ITP 301, the task was even more simple than the previous one, namely create a page that describes your life in a nutshell AND javascript that will modify the CSS of various parts of the page. Using radio buttons and a pair of JS functions, a user can easily swap out the background to whatever basic colors they want and to a font color they\'d prefer.","images":[{"src":"https://i.imgur.com/6lRZSbd.png","alt":"Two columns of radio buttons relating to background and text color with a main image sitting alongside paragraphs about my life and school."}],"github":"https://github.com/NLCaceres/js-color-control","url":"https://nlcaceres.github.io/js-color-control/"},{"name":"Need a Calculator?","desc":"Getting into the groove of my first Web Development class, we finally got into a project that was a bit more practical and useful, a calculator! Picking out a few images for calculator buttons and laying them out as expected for a calculator, I added onClick attributes to each button which would add numbers to the text input sitting atop. As the user clicks the operators along the side, the number will disappear in the text field and allow the next number to be input until you finally click the equals sign and get your result. Simple and plenty useful!","images":[{"src":"https://imgur.com/FduCCFf.png","alt":"Basic calculator with red buttons and a text input sitting atop it for numbers"}],"github":"https://github.com/NLCaceres/calculator-webApp","url":"https://nlcaceres.github.io/calculator-webApp/"},{"name":"The New and Improved Photo Gallery","desc":"Improving upon the previous jQuery gallery my ITP 301 class had made, I\'d change the layout adding more images, focus it around my girlfriend and I\'s Walt Disney World trip, and use vanilla Javascript alone. The main image frame and row images would function similarly, highlighting onHover, swapping onClick, but I\'d include a row of random images underneath the main image and above the gallery of images. With the row of random images, I included a random button that would choose a set of three images to display (though it could choose two of the same). Not perfect, but a good step towards a fully fledged project and one heck of a road trip!","images":[{"src":"https://imgur.com/XVzYyDm.png","alt":"Home screen displaying the login.

Pressing enter with an empty search bar will give you a full list of around 20 websites that I use whether for news, for entertainment or for shopping, but otherwise the search bar will act as one might expect and return any websites that relate to the keyword a user types in.","images":[{"src":"https://imgur.com/XJX7BSA.png","alt":"Home screen displaying the login.
