      "name": "Positive Note Android",
      "desc": "This was the first major app I wrote in Android. In the class that first taught me Android development, we were asked to create an app that would help those in their day-to-day lives whether that was an acessibility issue, a handicap, or simply a health-related concern. Being a Biology major focused in Neuroscience, I immediately thought about the issue of mental illness. I hoped to create an app that would help users to be able to voice their concerns about their mental well-being if they felt they could not do so. Ideally I could create a chat system, map out local mental health professionals, display helpful articles and create a simple login. The biggest concern, and ultimately the task I could not complete, was the chat system. I had hoped to create a system that would connect users who felt they could help in certain topics whether relationships, depression, or simply daily troubles with users who were having trouble in these topics. Though the system was established programmatically with Firebase (just before Google acquired it), it didn't function as intended. Consequently, the remainder was fleshed out as best as possible within the time frame, and the chat system was kept basic. Despite my shortcomings, it taught me a number of important lessons from project management, laying out tasks, and interacting with a number of different technologies.",

      "desc": "This app started in Android before moving more recently into iOS. Originally an idea of my father's, I began this app to help solve an issue of data collection and data visualization for his department, Infection Control, at work. However, as I worked out the details with him, it became more apparent how helpful this app could be for not only his own hospital but for hospitals in general. In his experience, hospitals often lag behind in terms of technology, despite being able to benefit immensely from the revolution data collection and computeres can bring.",

Eventually, I would be able to take a class focused on Android and use the knowledge that came from learning iOS to move more smoothly into Android. As stated in my iOS section, the idea for this app came from conversations with my best friend about an all encompassing fitness and health app. There are plenty of apps that cover nutrition, and plenty that cover exercise, but we wanted an app that would fit it all in one clean space.",
