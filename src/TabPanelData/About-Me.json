Here you'll find my small endeavors into the Software Development world ranging from front-end to mobile and even lower-level GUI programming (tab coming soon). Aside from software development, I've been a waiter, pizza and package delivery guy, and even a property manager. Having worked in these other fields has helped my confidence immensely to take on any task and give it my all. \n \n \tThere's a time for work and a time for play, though, and my hobbies definitely help make my days even better.",
