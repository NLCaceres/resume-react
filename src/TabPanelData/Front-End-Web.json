      "desc": "Originally an idea of my father's, I began this app to help solve an issue of data collection and data visualization for his department, Infection Control, at work. However, as I worked out the details with him, it became more apparent how helpful this app could be for not only his own hospital but in general. In his experience, hospitals often lag behind in terms of technology, despite being able to benefit immensely from the revolution data collection and computeres can bring.",

Unfortunately, keychain was horribly bugged at the time and required at least a few workarounds to get it to properly work. After searching tirelessly to find some way to make keychain work as intended and laid out by Apple's documents, I found several suggestions on StackOverflow and various sites online on what to change to enable keychain. Finally a user could write notes that were secure from any prying eyes.",
