However, as I worked out the details with him, it became more apparent how helpful this app could be for not only his own hospital but in general. In his experience, hospitals often lag behind in terms of technology, despite being able to benefit immensely from the revolution data collection and computeres can bring.",

Picking out a few images for calculator buttons and laying them out as expected for a calculator, I added onClick attributes to each button which would add numbers to the text input sitting atop. As the user clicks the operators along the side, the number will disappear in the text field and allow the next number to be input until you finally click the equals sign and get your result. Simple and plenty useful!",

The main image frame and row images would function similarly, highlighting onHover, swapping onClick, but I'd include a row of random images underneath the main image and above the gallery of images. With the row of random images, I included a random button that would choose a set of three images to display (though it could choose two of the same). Not perfect, but a good step towards a fully fledged project and one heck of a road trip!",

Having the minor under my belt, I paired with a classmate, Duncan, a CS Major. Though our schedules didn't ever seem to fit, this was the perfect opportunity to make use of Github. With Github on our side, we were able to divide and conquer fairly quickly. Unfortunately our merge conflicts made things difficult as our presentations finally arrived, but we fixed them in record time and had a presentable flipbook for all to enjoy.",
